## Part 1: Individual Rethinking (Updating Our Own View)
### A Preacher, A Prosecuter, a Politician, and a Scientist Walk into Your Mind
- "Progress is impossible without change; and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything" (George Bernard Shaw)
- More important than every to update beliefs because we live in rapidly evolving world.
- Human nature to value feeling right over being right
- 3 modes of speak: 
    - Preacher: "protect and promote our ideals"
    - Prosecuter: "prove them wrong and win our case"
    - Politician: "seeking to win over an audience"
- Act as a Scientist cutting through the noise, run experiments, and discover knowledge.
- Biases
    - Confirmation bias: "seeing what we expect to see"
    - Desirability bias: "seeing what we want to see"
- Don't let your ideas become ideologies, remember to keep an open mind and pivot.
- "Recognizing our shortcomings opens the door to doubt."
- Rethiking cycle: Curiosity -> Discovery -> Humility -> Doubt -> Curiosity
- Overconfidence cycle: Biases -> Validation -> Pride -> Conviction -> Biases
- Express innovations as extensions of existing nature to induce continuity and identity.

### The Armchair Quaarterback and the Imposter (Finding the Sweet Spot of Confidence)
- "Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge" (Charles Darwin)
- "In theory, confidence and competence go hand in hand. In practice, they often diverge."
- Dunning-Kruger Effect: People who lack competence are more likely to be overconfident in their abilities.
- We cannot be judges of excellence when we fail to possess the skills required to achieve excellence.
- "Arrogance is ignorance plus conviction. While humility is a permeable filter that absorbs life experience and converts it into knowledge and wisdom, arroagnce is a rubber shield that life experience simply bounces off of." (Tim Urban)
- Important to be confident in our capabilities to learn and overcome, while maintaining a sense of humility and curiosity in our approach. 
- Effective leaders are humble and confident.
- Imposter syndrome can motive us to work harder, smarter, and be better learners. 
- Interpreting doubt as a sign to improve, ask questions, and take in new ideas.
- "[Great thinkers] don't boast about how much they know; they marvel at how little they understand. They're aware that each answer raises new questions, and the quest for knowledge is nver finished. A mark of lifelong learners is recognizing that they can learn something from everyone they meet."

### The Joy of Being Wrong (The Thrill of Not Believing Everything You Think)
- Totalitarian ego: defensive nature when a core belife is questioned
- Rejoice in being wrong because it signifies you'll be less wrong in the future. 
- Detach: present from past, and opinions from your identity
    - "If you don't look back at yourself and think 'Wow, how stupid I was a year ago,' then you must not have learned much in the last year" (Ray Dalio)
    - Let values guide identity to allow for flexible changes in your opinions as you're presented with new information
- "Try to disprove yourself. When you're wrong, it's not something to be depressed about. Say, 'Hey, I discovered something!'" (Jean-Pierre Beugoms)
- Admitting your wrong is a sign of honesty and a willingness to learn.

### The Good Fight Club (The Psychology of Contructive Conflict)
- Differentiate "relationship conflict" with "task conflict"
    - "relationship conflict": personal/emotional
    - "task conflict": revolve around ideas and opinions
- Research shows high performing groups exhibit high levels of task conflict and low levels of relationship conflict.
- "The absence of conflict is not harmony, it's apathy."
- Develop a "challenge network": group who actively pushes you to rethink, humbles you about your areas of expertise, doubt your knowledge, and be curious about new perspectives.
- "avoiding an argument is bad manners. Silence disrespects the value of your views and our ability to have a civil disagreement"
- "Agreeableness is about seeking social harmony, not cognitive consensus."
- Research shows framing something as a debate rather than a disagreement engages both parties in a more civil discussion.
- Argue the how, not the why. Arguing the "why" about beliefs and ideas becomes emotional and personal.
