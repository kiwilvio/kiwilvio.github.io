### Session 1

Readings:  
‘IMF World Bank Comment’ Gensler, The Banker (September 2018).  
‘The blockchain catalyst for change’ Vox (July 16, 2018) 

1. What is blockchain technology and why might it be a catalyst for change for the financial sector?  
Blockchain technology is a software system that powers a "decentralized peer-to-peer form of shared record keeping” [1]. It might be a catalyst for change in the financial sector because of its ability to eliminate unnecesary reconciliations, allow for greater economic activity between individuals without the need for an intermediary, and potential use cases yet to be discovered.


2. What do you as a student wish to learn from this course, ‘Blockchain and Money’?  
An understanding of this new technology and foresee potential effects of it in the financial industry and beyond. 


selected quotes from readings:  
- a new software system that powers a consensus-driven form of shared record keeping – enabling the digital transfer of value in a decentralised manner.
one digital ledger prevents ‘double spending’
- A blockchain is a consensus protocol used to create an append-only log (in the case of Bitcoin, a transaction ledger) that can then be used to form an auditable database (in Bitcoin, a record of who owns which coins). This database is constructed by multiple, possibly distrusting participants and is secured using cryptography so that every entry can be audited and verified.
- In theory, such a system could end the need for costly, time-consuming reconciliation across separate, centralized ledgers run by multiple entities.
 It could also enable new forms of economic activity that were previously impossible in the absence of reliable, intermediating record-keepers.
- We believe this technology could reduce the ingrained ‘cost of trust’ that currently adds friction to commerce and enriches trust-intermediating gatekeepers across the economy.
- They are conceiving of a host of new potential uses: for cross-border payments, in clearing and settlement for financial transactions, for supply-chain management, for device-to-device transactions in the Internet of Things, to create more reliable property and asset registries, to forge portable digital identities, and to improve record-sharing in sensitive areas such as health care.

### Session 2

1. What do the roles (medium of exchange, store of value, & unit of account) and characteristics (durable, portable, divisible, uniform, acceptable & stable) of money mean historically and in today’s digital economy?
Historically, it allows for different forms of trade to develop. There was barter and there were credit systems. Some stone methods allowed for a simple unit of account and medium of exchange to develop, while not being too overly easy to mine. The sticks were also a convenient way to measure credit. As we shift, to a more digital economy (ie. digital yuan and norway) the medium of exchange begins to shift from fiat paper money to fiat digital money. This increases the necessity for strong cryptography fundamentals behind the money because it is no longer something tangible with verifiable factors; but rather, digital indicators. If all goes well, it vastly increases all characteristics of money. A main drawback of digital currency could be that poorer people get left behind. Without a phone, or mean of internet access, it might be hard for them to enable mobile payments or similar methods. 

2. What is fiat currency, what are its ledgers, and how does it fit within the history of money?
How does Bitcoin fit within the history of money, the emergence of the Internet and failed attempts of cryptographic payment systems?
Fiat currency is money that is not backed by a commodity. Specifically, it derives its value from government decree. It is the basis of money as a social contract. Ledgers are a record of events. They have become synonymous with accounting records to record transactions. Bitcoin looks to disrupt the traditional ledger system because of its unique distributed ledger system. Because it is a trusted, peer-to-peer network it can potentially cut out the need for a centralized ledger. The bane of many prior attempts of digital currency was the issue of double spending, enterprise buy-in, and the need for centralized ledgers. Blockchain solves all of these.
