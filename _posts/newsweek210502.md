[The Crypto State? (City Journal)](https://www.city-journal.org/technological-developments-new-systems-of-governance)  
Maçães bring forth the idea that arguing whether US or China will reign supreme is irrelevent as we move towards a new system of governance. Technology has shifted power dynamics throughout history from horses to metal tools and nothing has chanaged today. Modern technologies such as Google, Facebook, and now Bitcoin have transformed how we think and interact. Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, bypass the need for an intermediary. As Maçães notess "no large multinational corporation captures the data, no banks are involved, and no state authority can tamper with the record". He further identifies the identity shift between the physical and digital records. While physical documents enable surface-level identication such as nationality, age, etc., digital records provide far more information on an individual – which the Tech Titans have been profiting off for a decade.  

Bitcoin's ability to act indepentdently of the public or private sector allows for the emergence of a new era. While Bitcoin is one application of blockchain technology, Maçães purports "the ultimate promise of crypto lies less with digital currencies than with the replacement of other state structures." Money is a perfect starting point for developing proof-of-concept for this disruptive technology because–as we've seen time and time again–finance is the heart of the economy. If blockchain technology can replace the banking industry and become a viable distributed network then the idea of too "big to fail" vanishes into thin air because their importance is diminished (however, I still see investment banking as a profitable industry, but hopefully seperated from commercial banking).  

The second half of the article focuses on potential use cases such a betting market and insurance smart contracts. An interesting section discusses the consequences of crytographic keys and anonymized transaction on the tax industry. Mainly, that it becomes near imposible to collect taxes. Maçães sees China as the only nation-state capable of embracing the transition.  

Fun quote:  
"Bitcoin was intended as a response to the distempers of a global financial system that somehow manages to give private companies free rein to enrich themselves, while keeping public authorities ultimately in charge."

Facebook vs. Apple: Battle for Advertising (MorningBrew)  
Overview:
- Apple is releasing iOS 14.5 with a new feature called _App Tracking Transparency_ allowing users to take control of apps' ability to track them across the internet. 
- This is a huge disruptor to the entire advertising industry (estimated to be around 138.61 billion dollars).
- Not suprising to see Facebook is strongly opposed to the feature arguing it hurts small businesses.
- Interesting to see how this, and data privacy as a whole, will continue to play out
