## About me
I am a student at the University of California, Davis studying Mathematical Analytics and Operations research. I hope to pursue a career in data science/analytics because of my passion for optimization and gaining a deeper understanding of patterns. Academically, I am interested in machine learning, optimization (convex and combinatorial), and probability. If you’d like to see more of my professional experience, make sure to check out the Resume tab. This website is mainly a collection of knowledge (a personal library, if you will) from things I read and see.

## Hobbies
My hobbies are sort of a revolving door. I keep coming back to the same things, but the amount I dedicate to any single thing is constantly changing. A few activities I enjoy are:

## University Involvement

In June 2021, I will graduate from the University of California, Davis with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematical Analytics and Operations Research.  
I'm an [ambassador for the College of Letters and Science]("https://lettersandscience.ucdavis.edu/meet-letters-and-science-ambassadors-alas) as well as a board member for the [Student Advisory Board](https://ue.ucdavis.edu/student-advisory-board).  
I'm part of the on campus bookgroup – ["Reading for Pleasure"](https://aggielife.ucdavis.edu/organization/bookgroup). I've previously served as president of [Moneyball Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/180006169233528/) at UC Davis and founder of the [Chicanx Latinx Collegiate Association](https://clcaucd.wixsite.com/clca) (Latinx interest professional development club).  
I was a student assistant for the [UC Davis School of Law](https://law.ucdavis.edu/alumni/about/) in the External Relations office during the 2018-2019 school year. I assisted in a graduate student's research as an [undergraduate research assistant](https://keisuketeeple.files.wordpress.com/2021/04/level_k_predatory_trading-1.pdf) in the Economics department for six months during the 2018-2019 school year.

## Internships

I interned at [DoubleLine Capital LP](https://doubleline.com/) with the Operations team during the summer of 2020. My time was split between the US Funds and Client Reporting teams. My notable works included devising a robust outlier detection system, and generating leads for the sales team.  

I interned with the Sacramento Kings' Business Intelligence department throughout the 19-20 NBA season. I worked about 25 hours a week, while attending school full-time. My main responsibilities included overseeing our statistical models for forecasting ticket sales and season ticket member retention. Beyond that, I like to say I was a professional graph maker to help make informed decisions (ggplot and Tableau are my best friends).  

My first internship was with Kaiser Permanente's Data Security team in 2019. The Data Security team is responsible for analyzing/providing access to employees across KP. I reduced the time to update JRMs (Job Role Matrix) with a new process (\~4 days to under an hour), coded VBA scripts to automate monthly reports and wrote a report on the macroeconmic effects of the repeal/replacement of the ACA from a healthcare provider point of view.  

I also volunteered as part of the Talent Book Committee. The Talent Book Committee was a team of 6 that collected personal statements, photos and resumes from over 80 KP interns and designed a talent book to be distributed to managers accross the company. I was one of two lead contacts, acting as the main liason between the committee and the rest of the intern cohort.
