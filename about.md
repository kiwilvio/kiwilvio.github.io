## FAQ
_Wait, what's your name?_  
  Legally? Quilvio. Otherwise, it's Kiwi or QE. They sound the same to me so either one works, or you can just call me Q. Other spellings I've seen for it include: quie, que, queue, quilobo, quincy, quivalosa, quilava, qdawg, qberto.  
    
_How do you pronounce that? I want to make sure I'm saying it right._  
I just say "kill-vee-oh" but it's actually a little more like "QUIl-vee-oh", but again either works!  

_Where's that name originate from?_  
   My parents named me after a Padres baseball player in the 90s, Quilvio Veras. As for the name itself, from my understanding, it's Dominican.
     
_Fun Facts_  
    I, despite growing up in San Diego, don't know how to swim. I'm a huge fan of the word _kerfuffle_ for no practical reason. Alan Turing is my favorite mathematician (might or might not be because of Benedict Cumberbatch in [The Imitation Game](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2084970/)) and I really want to visit Toronto some day!
    
## Early Life

If this was my Wikipedia page it would say something about how I'm the youngest of 5 children, 3 of them being half siblings. My father works in law enforcement and my mother is a kindergarten teacher. I was born and raised in Chula Vista, California, a city in South Bay, San Diego.  
    I went to Eastlake High School where I failed to make the most of my high school experience. I ran Cross Country and Track, but video games were my passion. I'd typically play somewhere around 20 hours a week, but oftentimes more...
    
## University Involvement

In June 2021, I will graduate from the University of California, Davis with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematical Analytics and Operations Research.  
I'm an [ambassador for the College of Letters and Science]("https://lettersandscience.ucdavis.edu/meet-letters-and-science-ambassadors-alas) as well as a board member for the [Student Advisory Board](https://ue.ucdavis.edu/student-advisory-board).  
I'm part of the on campus bookgroup – ["Reading for Pleasure"](https://aggielife.ucdavis.edu/organization/bookgroup). I've previously served as president of [Moneyball Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/180006169233528/) at UC Davis and founding treasurer of the [Chicanx Latinx Collegiate Association](https://clcaucd.wixsite.com/clca) (Latinx interest professional development club).  
I was a student assistant for the [UC Davis School of Law](https://law.ucdavis.edu/alumni/about/) in the External Relations office during the 2018-2019 school year. I assisted in a graduate student's research as an undergraduate research assistant in the Economics department for six months during the 2018-2019 school year.

## Internships

I interned at [DoubleLine Capital LP](https://doubleline.com/) with the Operations team during the summer of 2020. My time was split between the US Funds and Client Reporting teams. My notable works included devising a robust outlier detection system, and generating leads for the sales team.  

I interned with the Sacramento Kings' Business Intelligence department throughout the 19-20 NBA season. I worked about 25 hours a week, while attending school full-time. My main responsibilities included overseeing our statistical models for forecasting ticket sales and season ticket member retention. Beyond that, I like to say I was a professional graph maker to help make informed decisions (ggplot and Tableau are my best friends).  

My first internship was with Kaiser Permanente's Data Security team in 2019. The Data Security team is responsible for analyzing/providing access to employees across KP. I reduced the time to update JRMs (Job Role Matrix) with a new process (~4 days to under an hour), coded VBA scripts to automate monthly reports and wrote a report on the macroeconmic effects of the repeal/replacement of the ACA from a healthcare provider point of view.  

I also volunteered as part of the Talent Book Committee. The Talent Book Committee was a team of 6 that collected personal statements, photos and resumes from over 80 KP interns and designed a talent book to be distributed to managers accross the company. I was one of two lead contacts, acting as the main liason between the committee and the rest of the intern cohort.

## Hobbies
My hobbies are sort of a revolving door. I keep coming back to the same things, but the amount I dedicate to any single thing is constantly changing. A few activities I enjoy are:
- [Reading](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113320568-quilvio-hernandez)
- Basketball
- Running
- Food.
